 site-packages : contains all the visualization libraries that we experimented with. Eventually, we finalized plotly
 Scripts/static contains css file that styles our website
 Scripts/static also has some png files that were generated while we were using matplotlib. No longer needed/will be generated now, as we moved to plotly
 Scripts/templates : contain all the jinja templates that we use on website along with some experiment files (other than those that are currently up on website)
 index.html --> This is the landing page of website
 bar_chart.html --> This template is corresponding to Bar chart task
 country_analysis.html --> This template is corresponding to tree map task
 LineChart.html --> This template corresponds to line chart task
 network_graph.html --> This template corresponds to network graph task
 wits_en_at-a-glance_allcountries_allyears 
 --> This folder contains all the summary files of all the countries from WITS website. 
 wits_en_trade_summary_allcountries_allyears
 --> This folder contains all the summary files of all the countries for all years from WITS website. This is the data we used in all code
 Country_codes_generator.py
 --> This is just a one time script to generate country name vs codes
 DV_Themes_Exploration.py
 --> This is the code for exploring various themes for beta and alpha releases
 country_vs_code.csv
 --> This is the output of Country_codes_generator.py
 dv_project_index.py
 --> This conatains the entire backend code to handle various user actions from templates
 some intermediate transformed files generated by code
 These are the various transformations of summary files in wits_en_trade_summary_allcountries_allyears when user clicks on view plot in different templates
 Transformations for bar chart :
 (I have just kept transformations for couple countries, not all 205. But below is the general process that happens in code when I run on local host)
 (When I execute dv_project_index.py in my local host and click on view plots from few templates, I see all transformed data, that i wrote in code works and csvs are getting saved in local host. But doing 
 that from website generates in my local host. I think its getting saved in website directory)
  Step 1 : en_(country_code)_AllYears_WITS_Trade_Summary.csv --> original file
  Step 2 : en_(country_code)_AllYears_WITS_Trade_Summary_filtered_bar_chart_task.csv --> Filtered and preprocessed form of the above file to contain only data relevant to imports and exports
  Step 3:  en_(country_code)__AllYears_WITS_Trade_Summary_transformed_bar_chart_task.csv --> Transformed/Aggregated from data from above step to only each product category and total net indicator value, sorted 
  by net indicator value in decreasing order
  Step 4: en_+(country_code)+_AllYears_WITS_Trade_Summary_transformed_filtered_stage_2_bar_chart_task.csv --> Filtered data from step 2 , to contain the information relevant to top-5 product categories from step-3 in years 2017-2021
  Step 5 : en_+(country_code)+_AllYears_WITS_Trade_Summary_transformed_filtered_stage_3_bar_chart_task.csv --> Aggregated from step 4: to contain net export - net import values for each of the product category
Transformations for line chart:
  Step 1 : en_(country_code)_AllYears_WITS_Trade_Summary.csv --> original file
  Step 2 : en_+(country code)+'_AllYears_WITS_Trade_Summary_transformed_line_task.csv --> will contain year,net indicator value in that year -- aggregated file
Transformations for network graph :
  Step1 : en_(country_code)_AllYears_WITS_Trade_Summary.csv --> original file
  Step 2 : en_+(country code)+_AllYears_WITS_Trade_Summary_transformed_network_graph_task.csv --> From the step1's country file(after preprocessing), this is aggregated one that contains all the countries that target country imported/exported with and 
  corresponding indicator values
Transformations for tree map:
  Step 1 : en_(country_code)_AllYears_WITS_Trade_Summary.csv --> original file
  Step 2 : en_+(country code)+AllYears_WITS_Trade_Summary_transformed_treemap_task.csv --> after preprocessing above aggregated format which contains product category, total indicator value
