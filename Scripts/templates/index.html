      <p style="margin-bottom:6px">Trade between the countries has become increasingly complex with rapid development of the
economy of the countries. This in turn makes it difficult to understand the data due to its bulk
and complex nature. So an effective visualization of the trade data would help the target users
to understand better. Our main objective is to visualize the world trade data in simple terms such
that they do not need any special expertise in the field of economics to understand the nature of
the trade data. Context of this study is to analyze the trade offs among several visualizations
and idioms to achieve specific set of tasks such as summarizing various products
imported/exported by a specific country in a specific time frame, viewing the net trend for net
trade values for a specific country in specific time frame, analyze the trade interactions between
a country and other countries over a timeframe, summarize the indicator value of various
countries that imported a specific product category over a chosen time frame. Several works
have been done in this subject in order to visualize this complex trade data like the WITS
website<ref>,<ref>,if any. We have plotted a bar chart, line chart, tree map and a network
graph in order to achieve our task’s goals. As ba result of our visualizations, we were able to
address problem statements like:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
          <li style="margin-bottom:6px">What are the various product categories and what is the net indicator value of each
category for a specific country in a specific time frame?
</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:6px">In a given time frame, what is the trend of net trade for a specific country?
</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:6px">In a given time frame, how much trade (import or export) is done by a country with all the
other countries?
</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:6px">For a specific product category, in a specific year, how much (in terms of a specific
indicator value) did all the countries import/export?
</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Domain and Project Motivation</h2>
      <p>With a vast amount of trade data available, this project aims at developing a set of visualizations which could help users draw valuable descriptive inferences which in turn, would help the users to understand our visualizations without any sense or feeling of information overload about the imports and exports of different countries from trade data, since this is a bulk dataset. The WITS portal[1] does have certain visualizations that are good in terms of understanding and interpretability. However, there are certain things which we can do through this projects:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li style="margin-bottom:6px">Due to the size of this dataset, there exist certain visualizations that a set of users may feel stressed to understand. (like high-school students, non-FINTECH background people, etc).</li>
        <li>Few existing visualizations can be plotted in such a way that their understandability can be improved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The domain of this project is economics/finance. Potential users are typically the general population. We aim to develop the visualizations that help users compare imports and exports among countries in-detail with better understanding without any prior-knowledge or expertise. In the source website, it consists of some sophisticated visualizations. But through our project The visualizations would help the users answer the following questions:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li style="margin-bottom:6px">What are the various product categories and what are the indicator values for each category thats imported/exported by a specific country in a specific time frame? (Task-1)
          <br>{action, target} : {<strong>Summarize</strong> the indicator values of all products for a specific country in a specific time frame, View the proportions of indicator values of various product categories in a given year and timeframe}</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:6px">In a given time frame, what is the trend of net trade for a specific country ? (Task-2)
          <br>{action, target} : {<strong>Derive</strong> the net indicator value for a specific country over specific time frame, View the <strong>trend</strong> of net indicator value of a specific country in a specific time frame}</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:6px">In a given time frame, how much trade is done among all the countries for a specific or all product categories? (Task-3)
          <br>{action, target} : {<strong>Summarize</strong> the trade interactions of a specific country in specific time frame, View how much in terms of aggregated indicator value did a target country trade with partner countries in a specific time frame}</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:6px">For a specific country, what are the top-5 products having the highest net indicator value and what is their net indicator value in years 2017-2021? (Task-4)

      <p>Description for Wei Chen & Nyuying Wang (2022) Visualizing the changing geographies of international trade, 2000–19, Regional Studies, Regional Science, 9:1, 132-134 [19]: (Comparison of global trade in year 2000 and 2019 in padlet)
        <br>The paper visualizes how the total trade of different countries in the world evolved from 2000 to 2019. It shows two different cartograms one for the year 2000 and the other for the year 2019. In each cartogram, the known geographical position of each country is used to locate the country and color encodes the total trade value (Marks are shapes and color channel is used as a magnitude channel to encode net trade value). I found this source as an inspiration because it's in the same domain of our project and also pretty closely related to a few of the tasks which we want to achieve. This is closely related to task-2 of our project. In task-2, we want to see the net indicator value trend for a specific country in a given time period. Here we intended to encode the trend using a line graph where spatial position along the X-axis encodes the year and spatial position along the Y-axis encodes the indicator value. This idiom is chosen because its real estate efficient considering we will only have one country of interest for a chosen time frame. If I were to do vis in paper differently from the authors, I wouldn’t change the idiom because the task in the paper intends to see the trend for all countries and the cartogram seems efficient to show all countries at once . However, the bucketing of colors based on the net trend value chosen by authors didn't seem intuitive to me in some cases. For example, <100 billions of dollars uses darker green and 100-150 billions of dollars uses less luminous green. So, if I were to do it differently, then I would change color encoding with higher net trend values being more luminous than lower net trend values.</p>

      <p>Description for Trade flows between top 10 EU largest countries[20]:
        <br>The above visualization is a chord diagram which shows the nominal goods trade flow between the top 10 countries in the European Union(EU) from the year 1998 till 2018.  Each flow line(marks) represents the trade relation between the two individual countries. The opacity of each flow line indicates the magnitude of trade that occurred between the countries (magnitude channel) and color of each flow line encodes an individual's country’s trade with the other acting as the identity channel. This visualization is a source of inspiration for task-2 and task-3. In task-2, we have analyzed the net trade for a specific country with the other. In task-3, we have analyzed the amount of trade which is done between the reporter country and individual other or all other countries.
        <br>For task-2, we have to analyze the trend of the net trade for a specific country in a given time period. For this we have considered only the individual country and its nominal trade value(both imports and exports) and then aggregate of the entire trade for that year. The chord diagram would visualize the trade relation with the other country. Also, the trade value in the chord diagram is not the exact value of trade since it shows the round off figures and is in the scales of 100. This would hinder the user from fetching the accurate information required.With the present idiom, we aim to visualize a line chart which has an x-axis encoding the year and y-axis encoding the trade indicator value.
        <br>For task-3, we would analyze the trade value of an individual country with the other countries in a given time frame. With the present idiom of sankey diagram, it is difficult to evaluate the exact trade indicator value for between those countries since it seems to complicate the understanding of the user though the opacity of the flow lines. However, we can transform such visualization into network type data in order to visualize such requirements in an effective way.</p>

      <p>Description for “International Collaboration of antimicrobial resistance in the environment”[21].
        <br>In this paper the authors have done some analysis on antimicrobial resistance in environment Research. Here they have visualized the collaboration between the multiple countries that have contributed to this research. Here they have used the Network Graph or map to visualize. Along with that they have added the thickness to the connecting lines of the Countries. The thickness indicates the strength of the collaboration between the two countries. The higher the thickness the more strength between the countries. Likewise in Task-3, for the network graph we can add this feature to represent the trade value between the countries. As this can show the strength or relationship between the two countries just at a glance. Hence, we can show the strength of the relation between the partner Country and Reporter Country, the relation between the different partner countries and the reporter country in a particular year with a specific Product Category.</p>

      <p>Description for “US Trade Deficit after Trade War Tariffs” [22]:
        <br>The above visualization is a Bar graph which shows the USA trade deficit with China in blue bar and USA trade deficit in general with the rest of the world in Grey bar(color: Channel). The position of the lines/bars(Marks) encodes the magnitude of the deficit amounts over time. Higher values(positive) are positioned higher on the chart and lower values (negative) are positioned lower on the chart. I think that this visualization is a great source of inspiration because of multiple reasons but one of the main reasons would be that it is very closely related to the domain of our project and one of the tasks which we want to achieve. The task that we want to achieve and which is closely related to this vis is task 2. For task 2 we are trying to analyze the trend of the net trade for a specific country for which we consider a single country at a time and we consider its trade value which would be export - import and aggregate that entire trade for that individual year. The x-axis encodes the year, while the height of the blue and gray bars represents the deficit amounts in billions of USD. The bar charts make it easy to compare the total vs China amounts for each individual year, but line charts may better highlight the overall trends over time.If I were to do vis in paper differently from the authors, I would likely to use small multiple line charts to also include more countries, rather than just these two categories. The title and axis labels clearly communicate the figure's contents. The use of color to distinguish total vs China is effective given the goal of comparing them. For my purpose of showing trends in more countries, I would use small multiple line charts without color, relying on spatial positioning to encode values for each. This should allow trends across more partners to be compared both horizontally and vertically.</p>

      <p>Description for “Countries and Their Research and Development Spending” [23]:
        <br>The reference visualization is a Treemap which shows countries and the total USD they spent for Research and Development. The marks are the areas that enclose the country name and spending amount. The size of the areas is a magnitude channel and the larger the size, the greater the amount spent for R&D. The color is an identity channel where countries that are within the same continent are identified by the same color. This vis closely relates to our task 1 and the vis currently chosen for it. In both instances, the color of the treemap indicates what overarching category an area corresponds to. In the reference, it corresponds to the continent that the country falls within where as in our vis it corresponds to the type of good (capital, consumer, intermediate, or raw material) that the entry is apart of. Also, the use of size is the same between both vis’s, meaning a larger size encodes a larger value. For our purposes, I believe that modifying the color of the different areas so the overarching category has more pop (with more vibrant colors) is important but the relation between areas can still be discerned.</p>

      <image src="static/results1.png"></image>
      <p style="margin-bottom:6px">Figure 5(a) (Packed Bubble chart) , Figure 5(b) (Network graph) and Figure 5(c) represent three different ways to encode the countries that the United States imported various product categories from. (Here we did not show dropdowns for 5(a) because here we just intend to explore various marks and channels and transformation themes. For the final chosen idiom 5(b), we provided dropdowns to achieve the actual task). In figure 5(a), points are used to represent different countries and magnitude channel size encodes the net import value. In figure 5(b), points encode different countries. Size of the node encodes the net import value. Links indicate that import occurred between the countries that are linked. Color channel distinguishes the country of interest from other countries. This lets the user achieve task-3 because the user is able to select from the drop downs provided the country, year and type to view the other countries that country of interest imported/exported with. With the packed bubble chart, if two countries have similar indicator values, it's perceptually difficult to distinguish the difference. Figure 5-(b) adds little more context due to the following:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li style="margin-bottom:6px">Having a node that represents country of interest</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:6px">Distinguishing between country of interest and other countries</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:6px">Direction of arrow representing import/export (In the diagram since the chosen filter is import, its an inward arrow pointing towards the country of interest, otherwise it will be an outward arrow)</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:6px">Annotations indicating country name and net indicator value</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-bottom:6px">Figure 5(c) encodes the same details as that of Figure 5(b) but with an added option of ability to zoom in/zoom out the plot. Taking into consideration the semantics of data, transforming table data type to network data type seemed more appropriate because the links indicate that a transaction has occurred unlike the bubble chart. Because of its context and appropriateness of network type for the given data set, we chose figure 5(c) to achieve task 3</p>
      <image src="static/results2.png"></image>
      <p style="margin-bottom:6px">Figure 6 represents different ways to encode export/import values (in millions of USD) of various countries that imported/exported a selected product category in a selected time frame(In figure 6(a) and 6(b), we didn’t provide drop downs because here we just intend to explore various themes. For the final chosen idiom, figure 6(c), we provided drop downs to achieve the actual task). Figure 6(a) shows a tree map that shows various countries exported Capital goods in 1993 where each country is represented by an area mark and size encodes the export value. Colors distinguish different countries. Figure 6(b) encodes the same using a pie chart where areas represent different countries, color channel differentiates among countries and size encodes the net export value of the product by selected country. We can see that both these idioms are not good at handling large amounts of data .In pie chart, wedges overlap significantly when there are many countries and it's perceptually difficult to distinguish between countries having the same export/import value. In tree map, as the number of countries increases, labels of different areas overlap and the countries with small export/import value for a product are almost hard to perceive. To handle complexity we achieved task-4 by using bar chart with small multiples where spatial position along X-axis is used to encode countries, spatial position along Y-axis is used to encode the net indicator value and length of bars (lines as marks) encodes the net export/import value of a specific country for the chosen product. Since a bar chart with sub multiples is effective among three in terms of handling complexity and also because aligning along a common spatial position is most effective to perceive differences among values, we chose bar plot with small multiples to achieve task-4. This lets users achieve task-4 because users will be able to select product category, year, export/import  from drop down and then view the export/import values of selected product category for various countries.</p>
